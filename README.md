# Predictive-Modelling
**Project Summary: Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package Prediction**
This project is based on two case studies: Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package Prediction. The objective was to use predictive modeling techniques to maximize company profits and target potential customers.
1.	Gems Price Prediction: Utilized linear regression to predict gem prices based on multiple variables. The analysis involved identifying key factors influencing gem prices to optimize pricing strategies.
2.	Holiday Package Prediction: Employed logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to predict whether a customer would purchase a holiday package. The goal was to identify the key factors influencing customer decisions, allowing for targeted marketing and improved customer engagement.
Key Steps and Analysis:
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand data characteristics, identify outliers, and examine variable distributions.
•	Data Cleaning and Imputation: Addressed missing values and outliers using median imputation and scaling techniques to ensure data consistency for modeling.
•	Model Building:
o	Gems Price Prediction: Linear regression was used, achieving an R-Squared value of 91%, indicating a strong fit between the model and the data.
o	Holiday Package Prediction: Applied logistic regression and LDA. The LDA model showed better performance with an AUC score of 0.66, suggesting higher predictive accuracy.
•	Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score to compare model performance. LDA outperformed logistic regression in predicting customer interest in holiday packages.
•	Business Insights: Identified key factors influencing gem prices, such as carat, clarity, and color. For holiday packages, the analysis revealed that customers' salary and whether they were foreign employees significantly impacted their likelihood to opt for a package.
•	Recommendations: Suggested targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments, such as offering special deals to foreign employees and low-salary employees to increase holiday package adoption.
Tools & Techniques Used: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Scaling, and Performance Metrics Evaluation.
